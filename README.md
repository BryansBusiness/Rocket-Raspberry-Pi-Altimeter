# Rocket Raspberry Pi Altimeter

In this project I used a Raspberry Pi 3 with the MPL3115A2 MEMS pressure sensor. I integrated the whole Raspberry Pi to the payload area of the rocket and was able to 
display the data transmitted onto the terminal. Below is the diagram I followed to connect the Raspberry Pi and the Altimeter.

# Finishing the Raspberry Pi and Rocket 
After finishing the microprocessor and inserting it into the rocket. I went over to the launch site and got some good data!

# Results 
As you can see the rocket reached it's apogee at 82.56m. Thank you for taking your time to read this!
